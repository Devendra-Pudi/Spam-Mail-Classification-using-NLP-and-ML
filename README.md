# Spam Mail Classification using NLP and ML

This project implements a spam mail classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. It processes email data to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the email text data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Converting text data into numerical features suitable for ML models.
- **Model Training**: Training ML models to classify emails as spam or not.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained models.
- **Model Deployment**: Saving the trained model for future predictions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Devendra-Pudi/Spam-Mail-Classification-using-NLP-and-ML.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Spam-Mail-Classification-using-NLP-and-ML
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open `model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

2. **Use the Trained Model**:
   The trained model is saved as `spam.pkl`, and the vectorizer is saved as `vec.pkl`. You can use these files to make predictions on new email data.
